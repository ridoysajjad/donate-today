                <h2><strong>Food and Water</strong></h2>
                <p>Did you know? In the United States, food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply. But for these people, food is literally a luxury. And don't forget about a safe drikable water. Some countries in the world don't even have access to simple tap water. It is our utmost pleasure to be able to help those people.</p>

                <h2><strong>A place to live</strong></h2>
                <p>It's estimated that about two percent of the world's population is homeless. Two percent — it doesn't sound like much, but when you do the math, that's nearly 154 million people living on the street, in temporary dwellings, at refugee camps, and in other transitory and often dangerous conditions. We can help sheltering these people, even thogh it may be a very little minority</p>

                <p>Even as the world prepares to establish universal health coverage as one of the targets in the health goal of the Sustainable Development Goals, that 400 million of now more than 7.2 billion people in the world lack access to essential health services. Nearly 45,000 peple dies every year from not getting treatments. We try to provide healthcare to as many people as we can.</p>
